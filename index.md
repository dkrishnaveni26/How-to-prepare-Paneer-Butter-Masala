### Tips for best results:

- Tomato is one of the key ingredient of the dish, so ensure to use red, ripe and firm tomatoes.
- We can always use fresh store-bought paneer, but, for best flavour and taste it is recommended to use homemade paneer. You can refer [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9bwHBikW8o) as reference[^2].
- Paneer cubes can be fried and added to thr gravy for extra crispness. 
- It is recommended to use kashmiri chilli powder or bright orangish-red colour, apart from this ripe red tomatoes also contribute towards lovely orangish-red coloured gravy.
- Due to shortage of time if Cashews cannot be pre-soaked for 30 minutes, we can replace it with finely grind Cashews in powdered consistency.
