**Consideration** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Disk** | Backup of VM disks is parallel. For example, if a VM has four disks, the Backup service attempts to back up all four disks in parallel. Backup is incremental (only changed data).
**Scheduling** |  To reduce backup traffic, back up different VMs at different times of the day and make sure the times don't overlap. Backing up VMs at the same time causes traffic jams.
**Preparing backups** | Keep in mind the time needed to prepare the backup. The preparation time includes installing or updating the backup extension and triggering a snapshot according to the backup schedule.
**Data transfer** | Consider the time needed for Azure Backup to identify the incremental changes from the previous backup.<br/><br/> In an incremental backup, Azure Backup determines the changes by calculating the checksum of the block. If a block is changed, it's marked for transfer to the vault. The service analyzes the identified blocks to attempt to further minimize the amount of data to transfer. After evaluating all the changed blocks, Azure Backup transfers the changes to the vault.<br/><br/> There might be a lag between taking the snapshot and copying it to vault. At peak times, it can take up to eight hours for the snapshots to be transferred to the vault. The backup time for a VM will be less than 24 hours for the daily backup.
**Initial backup** | Although the total backup time for incremental backups is less than 24 hours, that might not be the case for the first backup. The time needed for the initial backup will depend on the size of the data and when the backup is processed.
**Restore queue** | Azure Backup processes restore jobs from multiple storage accounts at the same time, and it puts restore requests in a queue.
**Restore copy** | During the restore process, data is copied from the vault to the storage account.<br/><br/> The total restore time depends on the I/O operations per second (IOPS) and the throughput of the storage account.<br/><br/> To reduce the copy time, select a storage account that isn't loaded with other application writes and reads.
